I built a GUI so it should be fairly simple to evaluate.

In the console you will be prompted for the number of 
times you want the cycle to run. Enter desired number
of iterations.

You will then be prompted by the console if you want 
the East West sensor to be random or not. I figured 
it would be easier for whoevers grading this to also 
have the option to enter user values. Type in "yes"
for the values to be random and "no" to enter your own
value. 

The program will then run. The GUI will display two 
traffic lights. The one on the left labeled North South
is the North South Light and vice versa.

Every iteration the East West sensor will display how
long it took for the sensor to be triggered.

Lights change correctly.

Timer is displayed in GUI to see in time comparisons.

Total time displayed in console at end reflects the 
total time that should have passed. Compare to timer.
It is usually off by a couple tenths of a second.

Enjoy!
